## 🛠️ How Anti-Shannon Works

Anti-Shannon builds a defensive security layer around your applications. It sets up traps and diversions for AI agents trying to analyze or exploit your software automatically.

It interferes with AI “pentesting” tools by:

- Disrupting their scanning routines.
- Feeding misleading data to confuse their models.
- Creating artificial delays to waste their time.
- Using unique paths to break their automated strategies.

This approach is different from traditional security because it targets AI attackers specifically, not human hackers.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

Anti-Shannon helps increase your app’s protection, but no tool can guarantee 100% security.

- Always keep Anti-Shannon updated to get the latest defenses.
- Use strong passwords and other security best practices alongside Anti-Shannon.
- Monitor your devices for unusual activity regularly.
- Combine Anti-Shannon with antivirus or firewall solutions for layered protection.
