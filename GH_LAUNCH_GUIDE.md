## 3. Social Media Viral Hooks

### For X (Twitter):
"I built the first defensive 'Hall of Mirrors' for the AI era. 🐵🛡️

While everyone is building AI Pentesters like Shannon, I built **Anti-Shannon**. 

It doesn't just block bots—it drains their API tokens and puts them in an infinite generative loop. 

Re-claim your infrastructure.

### For LinkedIn:
"The meta has shifted. With autonomous agents like Shannon making pentesting 'free' and 'fast', defensive teams need to move from passive blocking to Hostile Defense.

I'm excited to release **Anti-Shannon**, an asymmetric defensive framework that makes automated hacking unprofitable. By using generative traps and exponential tar-pits, it targets the one thing AI agents have limited amounts of: money and context window.
